  <p id="text4"> Now you are approaching to the End. <br>
    It’s not chaos, nor is it the night, <br>
    since the night requires eyes to be seen. <br>
    It’s like a blackhole  but not entirely. <br>
    We shall only call it “End” <br>because of our barren mind. <br>
    Death is just merely a piece of it, <br>so is reliefs. <br>
    The End is an eternal mirror <br> that God would look at Himself, <br>
    and today we might as well.</p>
