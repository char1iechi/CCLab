  <p> <b>Wiggle! It's disco time!</b>
    <br>Who can do wiggling better than a caterpillar? And he is a moving, colour-changing dancer. 
    <br> He had carefully chosen his favourite bow tie for the ball, hoping he would wow everyone. 
    <br>Apparently, you could tell by the look on his face though, he is too nervous. 
    <br>But no worries! When the music starts, he gets into his own world.</p>
